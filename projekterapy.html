                <p>Living with mental illness is not easy. It’s a consistent problem 
                without a clear solution. While treatments like medication and 
                psychotherapy are incredibly helpful, sometimes people experiencing 
                mental health conditions need to do more day-in and day-out to feel 
                good or even just okay.</p>
                <p>Some common self-help suggestions people receive are to exercise, 
                meditate and be more present, which are helpful and work for many people. 
                However, other proven methods aren’t mentioned as often. Many of them are 
                quick and simple techniques that can easily be added to daily routines.</p>
                <p>Finding the right coping mechanism takes time and patience, but it can 
                enormously impact how you feel. If you haven’t had success with techniques 
                you’ve tried, or you’re looking to add a few more to your toolkit, here are 
                seven coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals worth 
                trying out.</p>
                <h3>Radical Acceptance</h3>
                <p>Radical acceptance is “completely and totally accepting something from the 
                depths of your soul, with your heart and your mind,” according to Marsha Linehan 
                (creator of dialectal behavior therapy). Included in this definition is the idea 
                that no matter what, you cannot change a situation. For example, imagine a 
                tornado is coming your way. Obviously, you can’t do anything to stop the 
                tornado; that’s not possible. But if you accept the fact that it’s coming, 
                then you can act, prepare and keep yourself safe. If you sit around trying to 
                will the tornado to stop or pretend that there is no tornado, you’re going to 
                be in real trouble when it comes. </p>
                <p>The same applies to mental illness. You cannot change the fact that you have 
                a mental illness, so any time you spend trying to “get rid of it” or pretend 
                it doesn’t exist is only draining you of valuable energy. Accept yourself. 
                Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to take care of yourself.</p>
                <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
                <p>Breathing is an annoying cliché at this point, but that’s because the best way 
                to calm anxiety really is to breathe deeply. When battling my own anxiety, I turned 
                to the concept of “5 3 7” breathing:</p>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Breathe in for 5 seconds</li>
                    <li>Hold the breath for 3 seconds</li>
                    <li>Breathe out for 7 seconds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This gentle repetition sends a message to the brain that everything is 
                okay (or it will be soon). Before long, your heart will slow its pace and 
                you will begin to relax—sometimes without even realizing it.</p>
                <h3>Opposite-to-Emotion Thinking</h3>
                <p>Opposite-to-emotion thinking is how it sounds: You act in the opposite way 
                your emotions tell you to act. Say you’re feeling upset and you have the urge 
                to isolate. Opposite-to-emotion tells you to go out and be around people—the 
                opposite action of isolation. When you feel anxious, combat that with 
                something calming like meditation. When you feel manic, turn to something that 
                stabilizes you. This technique is probably one of the hardest to put into play, 
                but if you can manage it, the results are incredible.</p>
                <h3>The 5 Senses</h3>    
                <p>Another effective way to use your physical space to ground you through a 
                crisis is by employing a technique called “The 5 Senses.” Instead of focusing 
                on a specific object, with “The 5 Senses” you run through what each of your 
                senses is experiencing in that moment. As an example, imagine a PTSD flashback 
                comes on in the middle of class. Stop! Look around you. See the movement of 
                a clock’s hands. Feel the chair beneath you. Listen to your teacher’s voice. 
                Smell the faint aroma of the chalkboard. Chew a piece of gum.</p>
                <p>Running through your senses will take only a few seconds and will help 
                keep you present and focused on what is real, on what is happening right now.</p>    
                <h3>Mental Reframing</h3>    
                <p>Mental reframing involves taking an emotion or stressor and thinking of it in 
                a different way. Take, for example, getting stuck in traffic. Sure, you could 
                think to yourself, “Wow, my life is horrible. I’m going to be late because of 
                this traffic. Why does this always happen to me?”</p>
                <p>Or you can reframe that thought, which might look something like, “This 
                traffic is bad, but I’ll still get to where I’m going. There’s nothing I can 
                do about it, so I’ll just listen to music or an audiobook to pass the time.” 
                Perfecting this technique can literally change your perspective in tough 
                situations. But as you might imagine, this skill takes time and practice.</p>
                <h3>Emotion Awareness</h3>
                <p>If you live in denial of your emotions, it will take far longer to take 
                care of them, because once we recognize what we’re feeling, we can tackle it 
                or whatever is causing it. So, if you’re feeling anxious, let yourself be 
                anxious for a couple of minutes—then meditate. If you’re feeling angry, let 
                yourself be angry—then listen to some calming music. Be in touch with your 
                emotions. Accept that you are feeling a certain way, let yourself feel that 
                way and then take action to diminish unhealthy feelings.</p>
                <p>You can’t control that you have mental illness, but you can control how 
                you respond to your symptoms. This is not simple or easy (like everything else 
                with mental illness), but learning, practicing and perfecting coping techniques 
                can help you feel better emotionally, spiritually and physically. I’ve tried 
                all the above techniques, and they have transformed the way I cope with my 
                mental health struggles.</p>
                <p>It takes strength and persistence to recover from mental illness—to keep 
                fighting symptoms in the hopes of feeling better. Even if you feel weak or 
                powerless against the battles you face every day, you are incredibly strong 
                for living through them. Practical and simple methods can help you in your 
                fight. Take these techniques into consideration, and there will be a clear 
                change in the way you feel and live your life.</p>
